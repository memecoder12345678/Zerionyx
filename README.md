Zerion is an educational programming language designed for learning and task automation.

## Why Zerion?

- Beginner-friendly syntax ideal for learning programming
- Built-in tools for common task automation
- Visual feedback and clear error messages
- Educational libraries for math and basic algorithms
- Simple file handling and system automation
- Great for teaching programming concepts to children

## Best Use Cases

- **Perfect for**: Learning programming, educational projects, and basic task automation
- **Easy syntax**: Designed for clarity and learning, not performance
- **Note**: Not recommended for computation-heavy tasks or production-level applications

## Example

<!-- Ruby syntax highlighting is used because Zerion's syntax is quite similar to Ruby -->
```ruby
# Hello World
println("Hello, World!")

# Variables and math
x = 10
y = 20
println(x + y)

# Functions
defun add(a, b)
    return a + b
done

# Or, for one-line functions
defun add(a, b) -> a + b

println(add(5, 3))

# Lists
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
println(nums)
```

## How to Use Zerion
- **Install**: Clone the repository from GitHub.
- **Setup**: Add Zerion to your PATH if you want to run it from anywhere.
- **Run a file**: `python ./interpreter/zerion.py yourfile.zer`
- **Open interactive shell**: Just run `python ./interpreter/zerion.py` and start typing Zerion code.
- **Get help**: Type grammar, license, or copyright in the shell for info.
- **Documentation**: Read the full docs here.


## Recommended Environment
- **For learning**: Python 3.11+ or newer (best for beginners and educational purposes)
- **For automation**: PyPy 3.11 (recommended when running repetitive tasks or automation scripts)
- **IDE recommendation**: Use [Zerion Editor](https://memecoder12345678.github.io/zerion/docs.html#Zerion-Editor) with syntax highlighting for the best learning experience
- **Note**: While the language is designed for simplicity, PyPy can significantly speed up automation tasks

## Zerion Philosophy

> Clarity is better than cleverness.
> 
> Consistency is better than chaos.
> 
> Freedom in syntax, but not in structure.
