## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Reduced Function Call Overhead

This release's primary focus was a deep optimization of the interpreter's call stack management. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the overhead associated with function invocation.

*   Scripts that rely on deep recursion or contain frequent function calls will now execute noticeably faster.
*   This foundational improvement makes Zerionyx more suitable for building larger, function-heavy applications and lays the groundwork for future performance enhancements.

Zerionyx 4.0.3 is a testament to our commitment to expanding the language's features and ensuring its core is as fast and efficient as possible. By strengthening the interpreter's foundation, this update ensures that Zerionyx can handle more demanding scripts with improved speed and stability, paving the way for more ambitious projects.
