## ðŸ›  Bug Fixes

* **Correct Float (`cfloat`)**
  Fixed precision errors in `cfloat` arithmetic where certain operations produced incorrect rounding in edge cases. Calculations are now consistent with the IEEE 754 standard.

* **Decorators Library**
  Resolved multiple issues in `libs.decorators`:

  * Decorators failing to apply on `async defun` are now correctly supported.
  * Nested decorators no longer cause unexpected stack overflows.
  * Error messages are clearer when applying invalid decorators.

## ðŸ“¦ Distribution Note

This patch release follows the same cleaned packaging policy as **5.0.0**, keeping only runtime essentials for end-users while removing development clutter.

Zerionyx 5.0.1-LTS brings improved reliability, making it the recommended version for anyone deploying applications built on the asynchronous runtime.
